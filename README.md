## Description
This extension adds little boxes next to class entries in ASU's class catalog that
tell you if they overlap with any class on your schedule. They're color coded but
reveal more information when you mouse over them. Examples of this are below,
in the screenshots section.

| Color      | Meaning                            |
|------------|------------------------------------|
| **Red**    | The class overlaps with another    |
|            | class                              |
| **Yellow** | This class is 15 or fewer  minutes |
|            | before or after another class      |
| **Green**  | This class does not overlap and    |
|            | is more than 15 minutes from       |
|            | another class.                     |

## Installation 
Install this extension (todo: put instructions here) and then you can hide the
button because it does nothing.

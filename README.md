## Description
This extension adds little boxes next to class entries in ASU's class catalog that
tell you if they overlap with any class on your schedule. They're color coded but
reveal more information when you mouse over them. Examples of this are below,
in the screenshots section.

Red means class overlaps, yellow means class doesn't overlap but is very close
to another class (and therefore may be difficult to commute to in the short
time) and green means the class does not overlap and isn't too close to another
class. You can always mouse over the little boxes for details.

## Installation
Install this extension (todo: put instructions here) and then you can hide the
button because it does nothing.
